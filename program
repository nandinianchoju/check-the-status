Given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag. The task is to check the status and return accordingly.

Return True for the following cases:

Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.
Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.
Otherwise, return False.

class Solution:
    def checkStatus(self, a, b, flag):
       if((a >= 0) != (b >= 0) and not flag):
           return True
       elif(a<0 and b<0 and flag):
           return True
       else:
           return False
explanation-The first condition should check if exactly one of a or b is non-negative while flag is false. You can use the XOR operator (!=) to check this.
The second condition is correct, as it checks if both a and b are negative and flag is true.
